Installation:
This script need to be run in 3.1 cli environment:
pip install cloudify==3.1

Configuration:
config.json must be filled with data.
You need to provide url to tenants.json file, cloudify manager user and path to private key.
For our purposes user cloudify is fine.

Usage:
For full healthcheck use:
python report.py generate --test-manager-ssh --test-agents-alive --blueprints-states --output report.json
Other combinations might give some unexpected results.

You can use --manager, --env, --blueprint parameters to reduce scope.
I suggest to use those for at least first run in environment.

WAIT BETWEEN SUBSEQUENT EXECUTIONS OF THIS SCRIPT!
There is some issue with ssh connections - when we create too many too fast, they start to halt.

Script supports command to_csv. So if you prefer this format, you can easily change it.
Note that some data from *.json file will not be available in *.csv file.
